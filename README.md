# Digital Twin-Driven Real-Time Collaborative Scheduling for U-Shaped Automated Container Terminals

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Digital Twin (DT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based real-time collaborative scheduling system for U-shaped Automated Container Terminals (U-ACT), as described in the research paper "Digital twin-driven real-time collaborative scheduling for U-shaped automated container terminals".

## Key Features

- **U-shaped Terminal Modeling**: Accurate simulation of U-shaped automated container terminal layout and operations
- **Digital Twin Environment**: High-fidelity simulation of AGVs, Yard Cranes (YCs), Quay Cranes (QCs), and External Trucks (ETs)
- **PPO-based Scheduling**: Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm for dynamic equipment scheduling
- **Multi-equipment Coordination**: Real-time coordination between AGVs, YCs, and ETs
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive monitoring of makespan, Terminal Congestion Index (TCI), and equipment utilization
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive visualization of terminal operations and performance metrics
